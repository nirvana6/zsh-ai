You know what you want to do, but not the exact command. So you Google it, scroll through Stack Overflow, copy something, adapt it, and hope it works.

**zsh-ai fixes this.** Type what you want in plain English, and get the right command instantly—ready to run.

```bash
$ # find all files larger than 100mb modified in the last week
$ find . -type f -size +100M -mtime -7    # ← appears instantly, ready to run
```

Works with Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Mistral, Grok, Qwen, and local models via Ollama. A single 5KB shell script with zero dependencies.

## Why zsh-ai?

**🎯 Just works** - Type `# what you want` and press Enter. The command appears ready to execute. No copy-paste, no adapting.

**🧠 Context-aware** - Detects your project type, git status, and current directory. Ask for "run tests" and get `npm test` in a Node project or `pytest` in Python.

**🔒 You stay in control** - Commands appear in your prompt for review before running. Use local Ollama models for complete privacy, or bring your own API keys.

**🪶 Lightweight** - A 5KB shell script. No Python, no Node.js, no package managers. Starts instantly with your shell.

## How It Works

1. **You type** a comment describing what you want: `# compress all images in this folder`
2. **zsh-ai gathers context** about your environment (current directory, git status, project type)
3. **AI generates** the right command for your situation
4. **Command appears** in your prompt, ready to review and run

The command never runs automatically—you always see it first and decide whether to execute it.

## Demo

### Method 1: Comment Syntax (Recommended)
Type `#` followed by what you want to do, then press Enter. It's that simple!

```bash
$ # find all large files modified this week
$ find . -type f -size +50M -mtime -7

$ # kill process using port 3000  
$ lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

$ # compress images in current directory
$ for img in *.{jpg,png}; do convert "$img" -quality 85 "$img"; done
```

### Method 2: Direct Command
Prefer explicit commands? Use `zsh-ai` followed by your natural language request.
